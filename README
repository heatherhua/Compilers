The program defines the grammar to find appropriate lexemes and returning the proper tokens using flex. Defining the grammar is simple regular expression pattern matching. In order to keep track of the the columns, we use the DoBeforeEachAction() function to increment the first_column field of yylloc when the appropriate lexeme is found in order to keep track of the start column for every token. When the appropriate lexeme is found,the last_column field of the yylloc flex variable is incremented by the length of the lexeme in order to keep track of the last column for every token. We increment lines everytime there is a newline "\n" found.
